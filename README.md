In today's world of digital revolution, the genesis of every idea is realised via its presence and reach over the world of internet. People rely on online marketing tools such as Facebook pages to broadcast their ideas over a wider audience. However, when asked about hosting their own webpage, they shy away stating either a lack of coding experience or sometimes, just a lack of a simple and intuitive tool to get them started. The art of designing simple and beautiful websites is lost to not only to the non-tech savvy masses but also experienced developers (including myself, guilty!) 

But what's the hooplah over creating a website? 

Why can't we make it as easy as ordering a sundae? Well, to answer all these questions and get rid of this caveat, we give to you: HABO

HABO (Heuristic Application to Build Objects) is an intuitive speech based web application that helps users build websites based on simple voice commands and allows them to publish their code on the go. We use IBM's Watson Conversation Toolkit and Google's FireData to help us achieve the same. For the purpose of the hackathon,  we implemented the functionalities of adding a menu bar, adding backgrounds, headers, creating posts with titles, images and text content. 

We also use Google-based authentication in order to accomodate several users who can create their websites, save it for future modifications and publish it on the internet for other internet surfers to see.

Extensions:
Within due time, we can also extend the code to include complex actions such as embedding videos/canvas elements and changing colours dynamically. We also intend to collect a user's choice patterns and run a neural network in the server to help make element predictions for an easier website generation. For instance, if a user is creating a blog-based website, the neural net can make suggestions on a layout based on image-text-image layout. For a content-based website, the neural net can make suggestions on better product placement for optimum outputs.
